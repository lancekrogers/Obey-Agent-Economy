# Phase Goal: 002_PLAN

**Phase:** 002_PLAN | **Status:** Pending | **Type:** Planning

## Phase Objective

**Primary Goal:** Define the submission strategy per bounty track, create concrete deliverable checklists, and plan the deployment and demo sequence so the execute phase can proceed without ambiguity.

**Context:** The ingest phase provides a complete inventory of what exists. This planning phase turns that inventory into actionable work: what needs to be written, tested, deployed, and recorded for each bounty track submission. Without this plan, the execute phase risks wasting time on low-priority items or missing required deliverables.

## Exploration Topics

What areas need to be explored during this phase:

- Exact submission requirements per bounty track (Hedera Track 3, Hedera Track 4, 0G Track 2, 0G Track 3, Base)
- Deployment topology: where agents run, where dashboard is hosted, what testnet accounts are needed
- Demo script flow: what to show in 2 minutes that best demonstrates the full economy cycle
- Gap analysis: mapping ingest inventory against submission requirements to identify missing pieces
- Track 2 contract stretch goal: effort estimate and go/no-go decision

## Key Questions to Answer

Questions that must be answered before this phase is complete:

- What are the exact required deliverables for each bounty track submission form?
- Which tracks are strongest and should be prioritized if time runs short?
- What is the deployment plan for testnet agents and the dashboard?
- What is the demo script structure (opening, key moments, closing)?
- Is Track 2 contract work feasible in the remaining time, or should it be cut?
- Are there any cross-track dependencies that could block parallel submission prep?

## Expected Documents

Documents that will be produced during this phase:

- `submission-checklist.md`: Per-track checklist of required deliverables with status
- `deployment-plan.md`: Step-by-step plan for deploying agents to testnet and dashboard to hosting
- `demo-script-outline.md`: Structured outline of the 2-minute demo video
- `track-priority-order.md`: Ordered list of tracks by submission priority with rationale
- `e2e-test-plan.md`: Test scenarios for full economy cycle, failure recovery, and profitability validation

## Success Criteria

This planning phase is complete when:

- [ ] Submission checklist exists for every bounty track with all required deliverables identified
- [ ] Deployment plan is concrete enough to execute without further decisions
- [ ] Demo script outline is reviewed and approved
- [ ] Track priority order is set
- [ ] E2E test plan covers full cycle, failure recovery, and profitability
- [ ] Go/no-go decision made on Track 2 contract stretch goal

## Notes

- Keep plans tight and actionable. This is the final festival -- there is no room for open-ended exploration.
- The demo script outline is high-leverage: a clear outline now saves significant time during recording.
- If the ingest phase reveals that a prior festival is incomplete, the plan must account for finishing that work during the execute phase.
