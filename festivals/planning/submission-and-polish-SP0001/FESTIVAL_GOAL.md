# Submission and Polish

**Status:** Planned | **Created:** 2026-02-18T13:41:01-07:00

## Festival Objective

**Primary Goal:** Get every bounty submission polished, tested end-to-end, and deployed for final judging.

**Vision:** All six projects are verified working together in a full economy cycle, each bounty track has complete documentation and demo materials, agents are running on testnet, the dashboard is deployed, and a rehearsed 2-minute demo script is ready. No new features -- only verification, packaging, and submission.

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success

- [ ] Full economy cycle runs end-to-end on testnet (opportunity detection through profit realization)
- [ ] Failure recovery paths verified (agent restarts, failed transactions, network issues)
- [ ] Profitability validation passes with documented P&L proof
- [ ] Each bounty track has a complete submission package (README, architecture, demo)
- [ ] Demo video recorded and under 2 minutes
- [ ] All agents running on testnet with observable behavior via dashboard

### Quality Success

- [ ] All six project READMEs pass a completeness checklist (setup, architecture, usage, bounty alignment)
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in end-to-end test suite
- [ ] Dashboard loads and displays live agent state within 3 seconds
- [ ] Demo script rehearsed at least once with no dead time exceeding 5 seconds

## Progress Tracking

### Phase Completion

- [ ] 001_INGEST: Gather all artifacts, outputs, and deployment state from prior festivals (1-4)
- [ ] 002_PLAN: Define submission strategy, checklist per track, and deployment plan
- [ ] 003_EXECUTE: Run E2E tests, fix issues, build submission packages, record demo
- [ ] 004_SUBMIT: Final review, submit all bounty tracks, confirm deployment

## Complete When

- [ ] All phases completed
- [ ] Every bounty track submitted with required materials
- [ ] Agents running on testnet and dashboard deployed
- [ ] Demo video recorded, reviewed, and linked in submissions
- [ ] No known critical issues remaining
